Trivia Game!
==============

Trivia Game! is a site based on the tv show Friends.

After Joey and Chandler correctly predict everything in Rachel's shopping bag and make fun of Monica, who Joey knows is wearing "old lady underpants" because it's laundry day, Monica's ever-burning competitive fire leads to an epic trivia game to prove that there's no way the guys know Monica and Rachel better than the girls know Joey and Chandler.

Are you fan enough to beat Monica, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, and Ross at their own game? Could you BE any more excited to test your knowledge of Friends? Step up and see if you can save Monica and Rachel's apartment.
